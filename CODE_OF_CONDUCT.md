* Using welcoming and inclusive language

* Showing empathy and kindness towards others

* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

All participants, including users, contributers, and project maintainers/owners, whether paid or volunteers, and regardless of the length of their participation with the project, are bound to this Code of Conduct as a condition of participation, and are expected to follow, uphold, and encourage its principles in good faith.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the owners as soon as possible at [abuse@enspi.red](mailto:abuse@enspi.red). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will met with a response appropriate to the circumstances. The confidentiality of reports, and reporter(s), of an incident will be respected.

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the owners with a concise description of your grievance.
